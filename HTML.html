<p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the main markup language for web pages. HTML elements are the basic building-blocks of webpages</p>
<p>HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites.</p>
<p>Web browsers can also refer to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to define the appearance and layout of text and other material. The W3C, maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, encourages the use of CSS over explicitly presentational HTML markup.</p>
